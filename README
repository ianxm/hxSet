length

new()
        create an empty set

add(item :T, ?cmp :T->T->Bool) :Bool
        add an item to the set
        returns true if it was added

remove(pred :T->Bool) :Int
       remove items from the set that are selected by the given predicate
       returns the number of items removed

has(item :T, ?cmp :T->T->Bool)
        returns true if the given item is in the set

isEmpty()
        returns true if the set is empty

union(otherItems :Iterable<T>, ?cmp :T->T->Bool) :Int
        add the items from the given iterable to the set
        returns the number of items added

intersection(otherItems :Iterable<T>, ?cmp :T->T->Bool) :Int
        remove items which are not in the given iterable
        returns the number of items removed

minus(otherItems :Iterable<T>, ?cmp :T->T->Bool) :Int
        remove items what are in given iterable
        return the number of items removed

clear()
        empty the set

iterator()
        iterate over items in the set
